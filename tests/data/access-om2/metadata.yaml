description: >-
  1 degree ACCESS-OM2 physics-only global configuration with JRA55-do
  v1.3 RYF9091 repeat year forcing (May 1990 to Apr 1991)
long_description: >-
  1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under 1990-1991
  repeat year forcing. 780-year spinup run ideal for use as a control
  run for perturbations. Updated configuration with many improvements
  from the original GMD configuration. Run exclusively on Gadi. (The
  last 260 years of the run include monthly outputs of 3D temperature
  field.)
notes: >-
  output051 also contains extra diagnostic output for closing
  the heat budget in both Eulerian model coordinates (ocean_heat.nc)
  and in temperature coordinates (ocean_wmass.nc). This includes
  snapshots of the temperature and grid-cell thicknesses
  (ocean_snap.nc). If you have any questions about using this output
  please contact Ryan.
