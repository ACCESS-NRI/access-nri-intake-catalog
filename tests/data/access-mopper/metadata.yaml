   AUS2200 simulations collections. Each simulation is a limited area model study of the entire Australian continent at 2.2 km resolution, using the UM atmospheric model. 
            This dataset is part of the AUS2200 simulations collection at NCI.
long_description: |
   "There's a total of 9 simulations:
    ashwed80 - ERA5+ERA5Land reanalysis data was used to provide initial and boundary conditions. The study covers the time period of 1980-02-18 to 1980-02-21, including the 1980 Ash Wednesday bushfires.
    ashwed83 - ERA5+ERA5Land reanalysis data was used to provide initial and boundary conditions. The study covers the time period of 1983-02-15 to 1983-02-17, including the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires."
