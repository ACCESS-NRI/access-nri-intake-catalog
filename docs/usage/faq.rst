Below is a list of frequently asked questions and accompanying answers:

.. topic:: Why do I get a :code:`FileNotFound` error when I try to load data from a datastore?
   
   This is usually because you didn't include the storage flags for these data when you started your JupyterLab session. Please make sure that you're a member of the projects that house the data you want to access (see :ref:`prerequisites`) and that you've set your storage flags correctly (see :ref:`are_setup`).

.. topic:: Can other data products be added to the catalog?

   Yes! If you know of a climate data product on Gadi that should be included in the catalog, please open an issue `here <https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-nri-intake-catalog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=catalog-data-request.md&title=%5BDATA+REQUEST%5D+Add+%3Cname+of+data+product%3E>`_ describing the product.
