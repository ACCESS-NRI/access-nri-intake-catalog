Welcome to the documentation for ACCESS-NRI's Intake Catalog. The catalog aims to provide a way for users to discover and load data across a broad range of climate data products, including ACCESS model runs.

This catalog, and the tools that make it work, are still a work in progress. We value your feedback, especially in the form of reporting issues/bugs or suggesting ways to improve the catalog.

.. note::
   Please open an issue `here <https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/nri_intake_catalog/issues>`_ if you have any questions after reading this documentation.
