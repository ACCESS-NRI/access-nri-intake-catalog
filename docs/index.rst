Welcome to the documentation for the ACCESS-NRI Intake catalog. The catalog aims to provide a way for 
Python users to discover and load data across a broad range of climate data products available on the 
Australian NCI supercomputer Gadi.

This documentation aims to support a broad range of users, from people just wanting to use the catalog, 
to developers wanting to help improve the tools that support it. Please click on the panel below that 
best describes you:
