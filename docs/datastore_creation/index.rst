Creating Intake-ESM datastores
==============================

ACCESS-NRI provides tools to make it quick and easy for users to create Intake-ESM datastores for model data that are not (yet) included in the ACCESS-NRI catalog. The following sections demonstrate how to use these tools. These sections may be of interest to users running ACCESS models who want to:

* easily open their model output for analysis
* allow others to easily find and open their output for analysis

.. note::
   If you don't know what an Intake-ESM datastore is, go back and read :ref:`what_detailed`.
