These pages provide some how-to guides in the form of Jupyter notebooks that can be run on Gadi:

* The notebook on `example catalog usage`_ demonstrates the basic functions of the ACCESS-NRI Intake catalog including searching for experiment subcatalogs, loading subcatalogs, searching for datasets in subcatalogs and loading data from subcatalogs.
* The notebook on `building intake-esm catalogs`_ demonstrates how to build your own intake-esm catalog for data from an experiment you have just run (for example).
