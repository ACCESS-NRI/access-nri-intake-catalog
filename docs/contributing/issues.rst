Feature requests/suggestions and bug reports
============================================

We are eager to hear about any bugs you have found, new features you would like to see or any other suggestions 
you may have. Please feel free to submit these as issues 
`here <https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-nri-intake-catalog/issues/new/choose>`_.

When suggesting features, please make sure to explain in detail how the proposed feature should work and to keep 
the scope as narrow as possible. This makes features easier to implement.

When report bugs, please include:

* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting, specifically the Python interpreter 
  version, installed libraries, and catalog version.

  .. note::
     You can check your catalog version by looking at the :code:`metadata` attribute of your ACCESS-NRI catalog 
     instance

* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug, ideally a 
  `Minimal, Complete and Verifiable Example <https://matthewrocklin.com/minimal-bug-reports>`_. If possible, a 
  demonstration test that currently fails but should pass when the bug is fixed.
