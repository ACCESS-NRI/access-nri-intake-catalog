====================

Another way to help is to contribute data products to the ACCESS-NRI catalog. Perhaps you've already created an 
Intake-ESM datastore for some climate data on Gadi (e.g. by following :ref:`datastore_create`) and you want it 
to be findable and useable by others in the community. Or you're aware of an ACCESS-related climate data product on 
Gadi that you think should be included in the catalog. Either way, we'd like to hear from you. Please open a 
catalog data request `here <https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-nri-intake-catalog/issues/new/choose>`_ providing 
details of the data product to add.

.. warning:: 
    If you are providing an existing Intake-ESM datastore to be added to :code:`access-nri-intake-catalog`, the 
    datastore must be in its final form **before** you make a data request. If a datastore is changed
    after we have verified that we are able to ingest it, it will break future catalog builds and may be 
    removed.

    If you need to update a datastore that is already in :code:`access-nri-intake-catalog`, please contact us as
    described above.
