====================

Another way to help is to contribute data products to the ACCESS-NRI catalog. Perhaps you've already created an 
Intake-ESM datastore for some climate data on Gadi (e.g. by following :ref:`datastore_create`) and you want it 
to be findable and useable by others in the community. Or you're aware of an ACCESS-related climate data product on 
Gadi that you think should be included in the catalog. Either way, we'd like to hear from you. Please open a 
catalog data request `here <https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-nri-intake-catalog/issues/new/choose>`_ providing 
details of the data product to add.
