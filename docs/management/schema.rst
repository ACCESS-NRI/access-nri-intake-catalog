Catalog schema
===============

As of version 0.1.4, the catalog schema is now a part of the :code:`access_nri_intake_catalog` package, rather
than being downloaded at the time of first import. Schema updates are handled by updated the 
:code:`access-nri-intake-catalog` code base.

.. warning::

   Translators are schema-specific. Certain updates to the schema may require that Translators need to be 
   rewritten and potentially other source code changes.
